    \textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system, a revolutionary approach to simplify the upkeep of ceiling
fans commonly found in homes and commercial spaces. In response to the persistent issue of fan
blades accumulating dust and debris, which can not only diminish their efficiency but also
present a daunting cleaning task, this innovative system employs cutting-edge technology and
design features to provide a practical solution. The heart of the system lies in its ability to
autonomously detect dust accumulation through specialized sensors, akin to the way our eyes
perceive things. When these sensors identify a significant amount of dust on the fan blades, they
promptly send a message to a dedicated mobile app specifically tailored for self-cleaning ceiling
fans. Users are then empowered to take control with a simple tap on the app, initiating the
cleaning process. This operation relies on clever mechanical components that employ small
brushes or rubber wipers to gently and effectively clean the fan blades, ensuring they remain
dust-free. What sets this system apart is its integrated dust collection mechanism, wherein the
removed dust is efficiently stored in a designated container. This collected dust can be
effortlessly released at the user's discretion, eliminating the need for manual cleaning and the
associated hassles.

\section{ \Large LITERATURE SURVEY}
\end{center}


\tab The information regarding the user’s experience with
 existing ceiling-fan cleaning tools is obtained and few new
 designs are proposed for addressing the user’s problems.
 A user survey was performed. From the result, it’s been
 observed that the user felt some pain/ discomfort in certain
 body regions like the neck, shoulder, and arm, as well as a
 major strain on the lumbar area. The other major concerns
 were also observed such as reachability, ease of usage,
 and ease of implementation (interactions with the product)
 while using the existing ceiling-fan cleaning tools/equipment
 [1]. The existing manual cleaning system’s limitations, such
 as human effort, sluggishness, and the risk of accidents
 are outlined, and the proposed solution involving a scissor
 lift mechanism actuated by a lead screw arrangement and
 controlled by an Atmega 16A microcontroller is proposed.[2]
 The system description details the methodology of cleaning
 the fan blades and the components involved, such as the
 microcontroller, motors, proximity sensors, electromagnet,
 and cleaning brush [3]. A comprehensive overview of a
 smart home automation system using Arduino as the master
 controller is provided. While the specific focus of the paper is
 on security systems, temperature sensing, and voice control,
 the principles and components discussed can be adapted for
 developing self-cleaning fans [4]. The Arduino board, along with
 various sensors and actuators, can be utilized to monitor
 the cleanliness of the fan blades and trigger a cleaning
 mechanism when necessary. The low-cost and open-source
 nature of the proposed system makes it a viable option
 for developing self-cleaning fans with added functionality
 [5]. The objective is to develop an IOT-enabled automatic
 vacuum cleaner using Arduino that can be controlled by
 using smartphone. Additionally, this robot is equipped with
 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors that can detect walls, obstacles,
 and cliffs. When there are obstacles in front of the robot,
 its movement will be modified according to the Arduino
 Mega algorithm. With the addition of a wireless ESP8266
 receiver module, the robot can be controlled wirelessly via
 a smartphone running the Blynk application. The user can
 choose between two modes of automatic cleaning, or they
 can control it manually. By incorporating these elements , we
 can create an IoT-enabled ceiling fan cleaning system that of
fers advanced features and seamless control through a smart
phone application [6]. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in
 home automation are explored, emphasizing their integration
 into smart home systems for enhanced convenience and effi
ciency. Extensive research in this domain showcases the evo
lution of cleaning systems, highlighting the transition from
 traditional vacuum cleaners to advanced, compact, and less
 intrusive smart devices suitable for office, public spaces, and
 homes. Within the context of smart cleaning devices, robotics
 and autonomous navigation systems have been extensively
 studied, focusing on algorithms, sensors, and mapping tech
niques that enable autonomous movement and environment
 mapping [7]. Furthermore, literature reviews emphasize user
centric studies, emphasizing user preferences, usability, and
 satisfaction factors when using smart cleaning appliances.
 Discussions also encompass challenges faced in achieving
 full autonomy, efficiency, and scalability in smart vacuum
cleaners, while exploring future directions such as enhancing
 navigation, optimizing cleaning algorithms, and integrating
 emerging technologies to further improve performance [8].
 An in-depth examination of existing research on automated
 cleaning systems is conducted, particularly emphasizing their
 application in high-rise structures with glass facades. This
 survey explores the challenges inherent in manual cleaning
 processes and highlights the risks involved for human work
ers, underscoring the need for safer and more efficient solutions [10]. It reviews prior studies on robotic cleaning systems,
 focusing on their mechanisms for traversing vertical glass
 surfaces, including structural designs, pneumatic systems,
 suction technologies, and control mechanisms. Moreover,
 the survey recognizes the expanding relevance of robotics
 in addressing maintenance issues in smart buildings and
 identifies potential applications beyond high-rise structures,
 such as in the cleaning of large solar panels. We can also
 adapt these traversing technologies and control mechanisms
 into our project [11]. An investigation is conducted into au
tonomous cleaning robots, focusing on their climbing mech
anisms, control systems, vacuum technologies, safety features, battery management, and future prospects. It explores
 existing research on robots designed for cleaning, specifically
 addressing their capabilities on vertical surfaces like glass,
 while delving into control mechanisms, suction systems, and
 motion planning algorithms vital for efficient cleaning which
 can be incorporated into our dirt defender ceiling fan system.
 Additionally, it scrutinizes safety measures like fraud detection, emphasizes battery efficiency for prolonged operations,
 and highlights challenges and potential research avenues for
 enhancing these autonomous glass cleaning systems [12]. This
 construction of a cleaning robot is focused, which provides
 wireless remote monitoring services [13]. Through modifying a
 commercial cleaning robot, various environment sensors,
 vision and networking capability are added to the system.
 It has many advantages over the traditional cleaning robot.
 This whole system consists of an IP camera, a computer,
 and a control board that drives motors on the cleaning robot.
 Besides, there are many sensors equipped on the robot, so it
 can measure surroundings and upload the data to the Appserv web server through Wi-Fi. The user can access the data in
 the server by using web browser [14]. Moreover the user can also
 control the robot remotely with mobile app. We can include
 the remote control feature into our system [8]. The computer
 functions were replaced with the ESP32 microcontroller, and
 the website server as well as the application interface was replaced with the Telegram BOT. The ESP32 microcontroller [15]
 was chosen because its function is almost the same as a
 computer, while the Telegram BOT can be used free of
 charge. This study focuses on testing the success rate of the
 system in responding to commands given via the Telegram
 BOT, with the type of command connecting the Telegram
 BOT with ESPCam, turning on or off the LED flash, taking
 pictures, and the combination [16]. Based on the tests that have
 been carried out for all existing command combinations, with
 each test being repeated 25 times, it was found that the
 success rate of the system reached 84.67%. The Telegram
 BOT serves as the interface for controlling our IoT-enabled [17]
 cleaning system(Dirt Defender Ceiliing fan), emphasizing its
 free availability and user-friendly command-based interac
tion. It highlights the security provided by HTTPS (HTTPSecure) in communication between the ESP32 board and the
 Telegram Bot API server:
 Data Encryption: HTTPS encrypts data during transmission,
 preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.[18]
 Authentication: It verifies the server’s identity using digital
 certificates, ensuring that the client communicates with the
 legitimate server and not a malicious entity.
 Data Integrity: HTTPS maintains data integrity by detecting
 any tampering or modification of data, ensuring that trans
mitted data remains unchanged.
 Overall, HTTPS ensures a secure and trustworthy connec
tion, protecting against eavesdropping, data manipulation,
 and impersonation attempts.[19]. The automatic solar panel
 cleaning system based on Arduino for dust removal can
 serve as a model for developing a self-cleaning ceiling fan.
 By adapting the two-step cleaning mechanism and the use
 of easily accessible components, a similar system can be
 designed for ceiling fan blades. The use of a wiper for dust
 removal, along with the integration of a microcontroller for
 control, can be applied to a ceiling fan for self-cleaning
 purposes . The proposed system aims to address the gradual
 decrease in solar panel efficiency due to dust accumulation,
 particularly in dry or desert areas, and is found to operate
 with an efficiency of 87-96\% for different types of sand.
 The hardware implementation includes the use of easily
 accessible components such as a solar panel, microcon troller (Arduino Uno), metallic DC gear motor, buck boost
 converter, and motor drive module, with the system being
 controlled by a microcontroller and a light dependent resistor
 (LDR) for sunlight tracking. By leveraging the principles
 and components outlined in the paper, a self-cleaning ceiling
 fan can be developed to improve efficiency and reduce
 maintenance requirements [20].

\tab The proposed Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system offers a groundbreaking solution to the perennial problem of ceiling fan maintenance. Utilizing state-ofthe-art technology, this innovative system is designed to simplify the upkeep of
both residential and commercial ceiling fans. At the core of its functionality are
specialized sensors, reminiscent of human eyes, adept at autonomously detecting dust buildup on fan blades. Once significant accumulation is detected, these
sensors communicate with a dedicated mobile app, empowering users to trigger
the cleaning process effortlessly. This process involves ingeniously designed mechanical components employing gentle brushes or rubber wipers to effectively
remove dust from the fan blades. What distinguishes this system is its integrated
dust collection mechanism, efficiently storing the removed debris in a designated
container. This collected dust can be conveniently disposed of at the user’s convenience, eliminating the laborious manual cleaning traditionally associated with
ceiling fan maintenance.

\textbf{3.4.1 Power Supply}\\
\tab The power supply section is the section which provide +5V for the components to work. As shown in Figure 3.4.1, 
IC LM7805 is used for providing a constant power of +5V.\\
\tab The ac voltage, typically 220V, is connected to a transformer, which steps down that ac voltage 
down to the level of the desired dc output. A diode rectifier then provides a full-wave rectified 
voltage that is initially filtered by a simple capacitor filter to produce a dc voltage. This resulting 
dc voltage usually has some ripple or ac voltage variation.\\
\tab A regulator circuit removes the ripples and also retains the same dc value even if the input dc 
voltage varies, or the load connected to the output dc voltage changes. This voltage regulation is 
usually obtained using one of the popular voltage regulator IC units.\\

\textbf{3.4.2 Transformer}\\\\
\tab Transformers convert AC electricity from one voltage to another with little loss of power as illustrated in Figure 3.4.2.
Transformers work only with AC and this is one of the reasons why mains electricity is AC.\\
\tab 
Step-up transformers increase voltage, step-down transformers reduce voltage. Most power 
supplies use a step-down transformer to reduce the dangerously high mains voltage (230V in India) 
to a safer low voltage.\\
\tab The input coil is called the primary and the output coil is called the secondary. There is no electrical 
connection between the two coils; instead they are linked by an alternating magnetic field created 
in the soft-iron core of the transformer. Transformers waste very little power so the power out is 
(almost) equal to the power in. Note that as voltage is stepped down current is stepped up.\\
\tab The transformer will step down the power supply voltage (0-230V) to (0- 6V) level. Then the 
secondary of the potential transformer will be connected to the bridge rectifier, which is 
constructed with the help of PN junction diodes. The advantages of using bridge rectifier are it will 
give peak voltage output as DC.
\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rectifier:
There are several ways of connecting diodes to make a rectifier to convert AC to DC. The 
bridge rectifier is the most important and it produces full-wave varying DC. A full-wave rectifier 
can also be made from just two diodes if a centre-tap transformer is used, but this method is rarely 
used now that diodes are cheaper. A single diode can be used as a rectifier but it only uses the 
positive (+) parts of the AC wave to produce half-wave varying DC
\item Bridge Rectifier:
When four diodes are connected as shown in figure, the circuit is called as bridge rectifier. 
The input to the circuit is applied to the diagonally opposite corners of the network, and the output 
is taken from the remaining two corners. Let us assume that the transformer is working properly 
and there is a positive potential, at point A and a negative potential at point B. the positive potential 
at point A will forward bias D3 and reverse bias D4.
The negative potential at point B will forward bias D1 and reverse D2. At this time D3 and D1 are 
forward biased and will allow current flow to pass through them; D4 and D2 are reverse biased 
and will block current flow.
One advantage of a bridge rectifier over a conventional full-wave rectifier is that with a given 
transformer the bridge rectifier produces a voltage output that is nearly twice that of the 
conventional full-wave circuit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The main advantage of this bridge circuit is that it does not require a special centre tapped 
transformer, thereby reducing its size and cost.
\item The single secondary winding is connected to one side of the diode bridge network and the load 
to the other side as shown below.
\item The result is still a pulsating direct current but with double the frequency.
\end{itemize}
\item Smoothing:
Smoothing is performed by a large value electrolytic capacitor connected across the DC 
supply to act as a reservoir, supplying current to the output when the varying DC voltage from the 
rectifier is falling. The capacitor charges quickly near the peak of the varying DC, and then 
discharges as it supplies current to the output.

\item Voltage Regulators:
Voltage regulators comprise a class of widely used ICs. Regulator IC units contain the circuitry for 
reference source, comparator amplifier, control device, and overload protection all in a single IC. 
IC units provide regulation of either a fixed positive voltage, a fixed negative voltage, or an 
adjustably set voltage. The regulators can be selected for operation with load currents from 
hundreds of milli amperes to tens of amperes, corresponding to power ratings from milli watts to
tens of watts.\\
\tab
A fixed three-terminal voltage regulator has an unregulated dc input voltage, Vi, applied to one 
input terminal, a regulated dc output voltage, Vo, from a second terminal, with the third terminal 
connected to ground.\\
\tab
The series 78 regulators provide fixed positive regulated voltages from 5 to 24 volts. Similarly, the 
series 79 regulators provide fixed negative regulated voltages from 5 to 24 volts. Voltage regulator 
ICs are available with fixed (typically 5, 12 and 15V) or variable output voltages. They are also 
rated by the maximum current they can pass. Negative voltage regulators are available, mainly for 
use in dual supplies. Most regulators include some automatic protection from excessive current 
('overload protection') and overheating ('thermal protection').\\
\tab
Many of the fixed voltage regulator ICs has 3 leads and look like power transistors, such as the 
7805 +5V 1Amp regulator. They include a hole for attaching a heat sink if necessary.

ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai- based Chinese company,

1.5 to 2.5 kg/cm and operates at a speed of 0.1 to 0.2 seconds per 60 degrees
rotation without a load, as shown in Figure 3.4.4. Operating within a 4.8V to 6V voltage range, it relies
on a small DC motor intricately connected to reduction gears, facilitating precise positioning aided by a potentiometer feedback mechanism. Controlled via
pulse width modulation (PWM) signals ranging from 1ms to 2ms, this servo is
extensively used in radio-controlled models, robotics, and automation, offering a
rotational span of approximately 180 degrees to enable accurate angular adjustments, making it a favored choice for diverse applications in hobbyist projects and
small-scale mechanisms.\\

\textbf{3.4.5 DC Motor}\\\\
\tab A DC motor in simple words is a device that converts direct current(electrical
energy) into mechanical energy,  as illustrated in Figure 3.4.5. It’s of vital importance for the industry today. A
DC motor is designed to run on DC electric power. Two examples of pure DC
designs are Michael Faraday’s homo-polar motor (which is uncommon), and the
ball bearing motor, which is (so far) a novelty. By far the most common DC motor
types are the brushed and brushless types, which use internal and external commutation respectively to create an oscillating AC current from the DC source—so
they are not purely DC machines in a strict sense. We in our project are using
brushed DC Motor, which will operate in the ratings of 12v DC 0.6A. The speed
of a DC motor can be controlled by changing the voltage applied to the armature
or by changing the field current. The introduction of variable resistance in the armature circuit or field circuit allowed speed control. Modern DC motors are often
controlled by power electronics systems called DC drives.\\

\textbf{3.4.6 Motor Driver}\\\\
\tab L293D IC shown in the figure 3.4.6, generally comes as a standard 16-pin DIP (dual-in line package).
This motor driver IC can simultaneously control two small motors in either direction; forward and reverse with just 4 microcontroller pins (if you do not use
enable pins).
\end{justify}

\begin{justify}
{\textbf{Some of the features (and drawbacks) of this IC are :}}
\end{justify}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Output current capability is limited to 600mA per channel with peak output current limited to 1.2A (non-repetitive). This means you cannot drive bigger motors
with this IC. However, most small motors used in hobby robotics should work. If
you are unsure whether the IC can handle a particular motor, connect the IC to
its circuit and run the motor with your finger on the IC. If it gets really hot, then
beware... Also note the words ”non-repetitive”; if the current output repeatedly
reaches 1.2A, it might destroy the drive transistors.
\item Supply voltage can be as large as 36 Volts. This means you do not have to worry
much about voltage regulation.
\item L293D has an enable facility which helps you enable the IC output pins. If an
enable pin is set to logic high, then state of the inputs match the state of the
outputs. If you pull this low, then the outputs will be turned off regardless of the
input states
\item The datasheet also mentions an ”over temperature protection” built into the IC.
This means an internal sensor senses its internal temperature and stops driving the
motors if the temperature crosses a set point
\item Another major feature of L293D is its internal clamp diodes. This flyback diode
helps protect the driver IC from voltage spikes that occur when the motor coil is turned on and off (mostly when turned off)
\item  The logical low in the IC is set to 1.5V. This means the pin is set high only if
the voltage across the pin crosses 1.5V which makes it suitable for use in high
frequency applications like switching applications (upto 5KHz)
\item  Lastly, this integrated circuit not only drives DC motors, but can also be used to
drive relay solenoids, stepper motors etc
\end{enumerate}

It works on the concept of H-bridge. H-bridge is a circuit which allows the voltage to be flown in 
either direction. As you know voltage need to change its direction for being able to rotate the motor 
in clockwise or anticlockwise direction, Hence H-bridge IC are ideal for driving a DC motor.
In a single l293d chip there two h-Bridge circuit inside the IC which can rotate two dc motor 
independently. Due its size it is very much used in robotic application for controlling DC motors. 
Given below is the pin diagram of a L293D motor controller.
There are two Enable pins on l293d. Pin 1 and pin 9, for being able to drive the motor, the pin 1 
and 9 need to be high. For driving the motor with left H-bridge you need to enable pin 1 to high. 
And for right H-Bridge you need to make the pin 9 to high. If anyone of the either pin1 or pin9 
goes low then the motor in the corresponding section will suspend working. It’s like a switch.
\\\\
\textbf{Working of L293D:}
\newline
\tab
The 4 input pins for this l293d, pin 2,7 on the left and pin 15 ,10 on the right as shown on the pin 
diagram. Left input pins will regulate the rotation of motor connected across left side and right 
input for motor on the right hand side. The motors are rotated on the basis of the inputs provided 
across the input pins as LOGIC 0 or LOGIC 1.
In simple you need to provide Logic 0 or 1 across the input pins for rotating the motor.\\\\
\textbf{Voltage Specification:}
\newline
\tab
VCC is the voltage that it needs for its own internal operation 5v; l293D will not use this voltage 
for driving the motor. For driving the motor it has a separate provision to provide motor supply 
VSS (V supply). L293d will use this to drive the motor. It means if you want to operate a motor 
at 9V then you need to provide a Supply of 9V across VSS Motor supply.\\
\tab
The maximum voltage for VSS motor supply is 36V. It can supply a max current of 600mA per 
channel. Since it can drive motors Up to 36v hence you can drive pretty big motors with this l293d.\\
\tab
VCC pin 16 is the voltage for its own internal Operation. The maximum voltage ranges from 5v 
and up to 36v.

\textbf{3.4.7 Battery}\\\\
\tab
A battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical 
energy into electrical energy. We use a 12V battery, as shown in Figure 3.4.7. Batteries are another way to produce electricity. They are smaller 
and more safe. Batteries have one end that is positive and one end that is negative. For batteries to 
work, you need to make sure you put them in the right way. Batteries have become a common 
power source for many household and industrial applications. \\
\tab
There are two types of batteries: primary batteries (disposable batteries), which are designed to be 
used once and discarded, and secondary batteries (rechargeable batteries), which are designed to 
be recharged and used multiple times. Batteries come in many sizes, from miniature cells used to 
power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power 
for telephone exchanges and computer data centers.\\
\tab
A battery is a device that converts chemical energy directly to electrical energy. It consists of a 
number of voltaic cells; each voltaic cell consists of two half-cells connected in series by a 
conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the 
electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate, i.e., the anode or negative electrode; 
the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the electrode to which cation (positively charged ions) 
migrate, i.e., the cathode or positive electrode. In the redox reaction that powers the battery, cations 
are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) 
at the anode. The electrodes do not touch each other but are electrically connected by the 
electrolyte. Some cells use two half-cells with different electrolytes. A separator between half-cells 
allows ions to flow, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes\\
\tab
Batteries are classified into two broad categories, each type with advantages and disadvantages.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary batteries irreversibly (within limits of practicality) transform chemical energy to 
electrical energy. When the initial supply of reactants is exhausted, energy cannot be readily 
restored to the battery by electrical means. 
\item  Secondary batteries can be recharged; that is, they can have their chemical reactions 
reversed by supplying electrical energy to the cell, restoring their original composition.
\end{itemize}
\\
\tab Some types of primary batteries used, for example, for telegraph circuits, were restored to 
operation by replacing the components of the battery consumed by the chemical reaction. 
Secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to dissipation of the active materials, loss 
of electrolyte and internal corrosion.\\
\tab Primary batteries can produce current immediately on assembly. Disposable batteries are intended 
to be used once and discarded. These are most commonly used in portable devices that have low 
current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, 
such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently 
available.\\
\tab Secondary batteries must be charged before use; they are usually assembled with active materials 
in the discharged state. Rechargeable batteries or secondary cells can be recharged by applying 
electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during its use. Devices to supply 
the appropriate current are called chargers or rechargers.

 intensity of light, allowing the system to assess whether
 cleaning is necessary based on the dust accumulation’s

 with excellent line and load regulation. This device is
 available in adjustable output version and it is inter

 components to simplify the power supply design. Since
 LM2596 converter is a switch– mode power supply,
 its efficiency is significantly higher in comparison with
 popular three– terminal linear regulators, especially with
 higher input voltages. The LM2596 operates at a switch
ing frequency of 150 kHz thus allowing smaller sized

 frequency switching regulators. Available in a standard
 5– lead TO– 220 package with several different lead
 bend options, and D2PAK surface mount package. The
 other features include a guaranteed 4\% tolerance on out
put voltage within specified input voltages and output
 load conditions, and 15\% on the oscillator frequency.
 External shutdown is included, featuring 80 A (typical) standby current. Self protection features include switch
 cycle– by– cycle current limit for the output switch, as
 well as thermal shutdown for complete protection under
 fault.

\begin{large}
\textbf{4.1 System Modules}
\end{large}
\\\\
\textbf{4.1.1 Sensor Module }\\\\
 \tab The Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system integrates advanced dust detection sensors that function akin to human eyes, perceiving and assessing dust accumulation on fan blades. These specialized sensors are strategically mounted on the fan blades, ensuring accurate and timely detection of dust and debris. The sensors operate autonomously, continuously monitoring the fan blades' cleanliness status. Once a significant amount of dust is detected, the sensors promptly send a signal to the system's control unit, triggering the cleaning process.
 \\
 \begin{itemize}
        \item Dust Detection Sensors (LDR Sensor): These sensors are crucial components of the cleaning system, as they detect the accumulation of dust on fan blades. They are typically mounted on the fan blades themselves to ensure accurate and timely detection.
        \item Edge Detection Sensors (IR Sensor): The Infrared (IR) sensor is a pivotal component in our IoT-enabled cleaning system, serving as an
        essential tool for detecting obstacles and edges during the cleaning process. This sensor emits and
        receives infrared radiation, enabling the system to accurately identify objects in its path and adjust its
        cleaning trajectory accordingly.\\
        
\end{itemize}
    
\textbf{4.1.2 Communication Protocols }\\\\
\tab To facilitate seamless data transmission from the sensors to the control unit and the dedicated mobile app, the system employs robust communication protocols. These protocols ensure reliable and real-time communication, allowing users to stay informed about the fan's cleaning status and take prompt action when needed. The integration of these communication protocols enhances the system's responsiveness and user experience.

 \\
 \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication Protocols: The Telegram Bot API utilizes HTTPS Protocol, as shown in figure 4.1.2. via the WiFiClientSecure library in our Arduino code, ensuring a secure and encrypted communication channel between our device and the Telegram servers. This allows our Arduino-based application to send and receive messages to and from Telegram users or groups securely over the internet.
        
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[htb]

    \
    \begin{center}
    \renewcommand{\thefigure}{4.1.2}
    \caption{\footnotesize  HTTPS Protocol}
    \end{center}
    \end{figure}
\\
\textbf{4.1.3 Cleaning Mechanism }\\\\
\tab The cleaning mechanism of the Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system is designed for optimal efficiency and effectiveness. It features mechanical components such as duster strategically positioned to clean the fan blades thoroughly. When activated, these components move along the fan blades, gently removing dust and debris without causing any damage. The cleaning process is orchestrated by a motor control system, which regulates the movement and speed of the cleaning components, ensuring comprehensive cleaning coverage.
 \\


 \textbf{4.1.4 Dust Collection Mechanism}\\\\
 \tab An innovative feature of the Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system is its integrated dust collection mechanism. As the cleaning components remove dust from the fan blades, the collected dust is efficiently stored in a designated container within the system. This container is designed for easy removal and disposal of the accumulated dust. Users have the flexibility to release the collected dust at their discretion, eliminating the need for manual cleaning and simplifying maintenance tasks.
 \\\\
\textbf{4.1.5 Telegram bot Module }\\\\
 \tab In addition to the dedicated Android mobile app, the system offers integration with popular messaging platforms like Telegram. The Telegram bot module acts as an interface, allowing users to remotely monitor the fan's cleaning status and initiate cleaning processes using simple commands. This integration enhances accessibility and user-friendliness, providing a familiar platform for users to interact with the system effortlessly. By using wifiClientServer library.

 
Overall, the Dirt Defender Ceiling Fan system revolutionizes ceiling fan maintenance by combining advanced sensors, intelligent cleaning mechanisms, and user-friendly interfaces. \\\\\

\textbf{4.1.6 Algorithm }\\\\
 \tab The algorithm outlines the sequence of steps followed by the cleaning system to detect dust accumulation and initiate cleaning actions. Here's a detailed breakdown of each step:
 \\
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Step 1 - Initialization of Sensor, Motors, and IoT:
 \newline Upon system startup, the sensor module, motor control system, and IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity are initialized. This includes calibration of sensors, motor positioning, and establishing communication channels.
\item  Step 2 – Checking if Sensor Gets Triggered:
\newline The system continuously monitors the dust detection sensors to check if they are triggered by the presence of dust on the fan blades. This real-time monitoring ensures prompt responsiveness to dust accumulation.

 \item Step 3 – Update Servo Motor Position:
 \newline If the sensors detect dust, the system updates the position of the servo motors. Servo motors are used to control the movement of cleaning components, such as brushes or wipers, ensuring they are directed towards the areas with dust accumulation.

\item Step 4 – Direct Sensor Trigger Moves Cleaning Robot:
\newline If a sensor is directly triggered by dust accumulation in a specific direction, the cleaning robot is moved in that direction. This targeted approach optimizes cleaning efficiency by focusing on areas with higher dust concentrations.
 \item Step 5 – Stop:
 \newline Once the cleaning robot has completed its cleaning cycle or if no further dust accumulation is detected, the system stops the cleaning process. This helps conserve energy and ensures that the cleaning robot operates only when necessary.
 \end{itemize}
 
By following this algorithm and leveraging the functionalities of each system module, the dust cleaning robot can effectively detect and remove dust from fan blades, providing improved air quality and system performance. The integration of the Telegram bot module further enhances user convenience and system accessibility, making it easier for users to monitor and control the cleaning process remotely.

\begin{large}
\textbf{5.3 Procedure}\\
\end{large}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Connect Dusters above and below the ceiling fan blade, with a wheel which drives forward and backward which is combined with DC Motor and ESP32.
    \item Attach servo motors to the cleaning mechanism (Wheel). Ensure proper wiring and connection to the ESP32 for control via motor drivers.
    \item Mount the dust detection sensors(LDR) and edge detection sensors(IR) on the fan blades. Connect the sensors to the ESP32 microcontroller for data transmission.
    \item Use 12V battery to supply power to the system.
    \item The code begins by including several libraries necessary for the project: WiFi, WiFiClientSecure, UniversalTelegramBot, ArduinoJson, and Servo. These libraries provide functionality for connecting to WiFi networks, communicating with Telegram Bot API, handling JSON data, and controlling servo motors.
    \item The network credentials (WiFi SSID and password) are defined for connecting the ESP32 board to the local WiFi network. This enables internet connectivity, allowing the ESP32 to communicate with the Telegram Bot API server.
    \item The Telegram Bot token and chat ID are defined to initialize the Telegram bot. The bot is set up using the provided token, and the chat ID specifies which chat or user the bot will respond to.
    \item Various hardware pins are defined for connecting components to the ESP32 board. This includes pins for LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), motor control (motorP and motorN for motor polarity), IR sensor, and a servo motor.
    \item When LDRState is HIGH dust is detected , the bot sends a message to the user, and if the "/cleannow" command is received, the flag is set to 1, indicating that cleaning should start. When the "/cleanstop" command is received, the flag is set to 0, indicating that cleaning should stop. The servo motor is also controlled to move back and forth during the cleaning process.
    \item The movement of the cleaning components forward and backward is controlled through the motorP and motorN pins And when an edge is detected it stops the motion. Forward Motion is achieved by setting motorP to HIGH and motorN to LOW and reverse for Backward Motion.
